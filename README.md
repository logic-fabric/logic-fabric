### Hi, I'm Lowic! Welcome to my code warehouse! ðŸ‘‹

Former Python developer and former math teacher, I make my own way to **become a design engineer / designOps** (front-end developer and UI/UX designer combo).

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently going deeper into _TypeScript_, _React.js_, the _Redux_ pattern, testing (_Jest / Testing Library / Cypress_) and algorithms.
- ðŸ”­ Next I'll learn more about OOP design patterns, functional programming and _Next.js_, then deal with UI & UX design in depth.
