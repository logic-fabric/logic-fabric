## Hi, I'm Lowic! Welcome to my code warehouse! ðŸ‘‹

As a **front-end developer freelancer**, I am on my own way **to becoming a UX engineer** (front-end developer and UI/UX designer combo).

ðŸŒ± Currently, I am:

- **professionalizing into UI/UX** and preparing for the [Google UX Design Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-ux-design)

- **going deeper in CSS** with Josh Comeau's course [_CSS for JavaScript Developers_](https://css-for-js.dev/) and Lea Verou's book [_CSS Secrets_](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/css-secrets/9781449372736/)

- continuing to improve my knowledge of **web accessibility** and **design systems**

ðŸ”­ I also regulary study other topics on [_Frontend Masters_](https://frontendmasters.com/u/Lowic_M/).
