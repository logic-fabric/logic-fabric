## Hi, I'm Lowic! Welcome to my code warehouse! ðŸ‘‹

As a **UX Engineer**, I am a combination of a Front-end developer and UI/UX designer.

My specialities are developpement with _React.js_ and _TypeScript_, UX heuristics (do's and dont's in UX) and web accessibility (a11y).

ðŸŒ± Currently, I am:

- **professionalizing into UI/UX** and preparing for the [Google UX Design Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-ux-design)

- **going deeper in CSS** with Josh Comeau's course [_CSS for JavaScript Developers_](https://css-for-js.dev/) and Lea Verou's book [_CSS Secrets_](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/css-secrets/9781449372736/)

- continuing to improve my knowledge of **accessibility** and **design systems**

ðŸ”­ I also regulary study other topics on [_Frontend Masters_](https://frontendmasters.com/u/Lowic_M/).
