## Hi, I'm Lowic! Welcome to my code warehouse! ðŸ‘‹

Former Python developer and former math teacher, I make my own way to **become a UX engineer / designOps** (front-end developer and UI/UX designer combo).

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently going deeper into testing (_Jest / Testing Library / Cypress_), _TypeScript_ and UI/UX.
- ðŸ”­ Next I'll learn more about OOP design patterns, functional programming and _Remix_..
