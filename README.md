### Hi, I'm Lowic! Welcome to my code warehouse! 👋

Former Python developer who was a former math teacher, I make my own way to become a design engineer.

- 🌱 I’m currently going deeper into _React.js_, the _Redux_ pattern and algorithmic.
- 🔭 Next I'll learn more about OOP design patterns, _TypeScript_ and _Next.js_,  then deal with UI & UX design in depth.
